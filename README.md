# TODO List Application

This TODO list application is built with Laravel for the backend and React.js for the frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides a simple interface for users to manage tasks with options to add, edit, delete, and filter them based on their completion status. This project serves as a technical assessment for demonstrating skills in Laravel, React, and optionally, Flutter for mobile support.

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile.
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for seamless backend communication.
- **Optional Mobile App**: Flutter-based mobile app with the same functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Laravel 9, MySQL
- **Frontend**: React.js 17, Tailwind CSS
- **Optional**: Flutter 3 (for mobile app development)

## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Laravel)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nina17arse/todo_task_list_medanit.git
   cd todo-app/backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your MySQL database credentials:
     ```plaintext
     DB_CONNECTION=mysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=todo_app
     DB_USERNAME=root
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password
     ```

4. **Generate Application Key**:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   The backend API should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend (React.js)

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React App**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Configuring the API URL**:
   - Ensure the React app points to the Laravel API URL (`http://localhost:8000/api`) as needed for your project setup.

### Mobile App (Flutter)

1. **Navigate to the Flutter Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../mobile
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the Flutter App**:
   - Connect a physical device or use an emulator, then run:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

   The Flutter mobile app should now be running, connecting to the same Laravel API for backend operations.

| Method | Endpoint         | Description              |

| PUT    | `/api/todos/{id}`| Update an existing task |
| DELETE | `/api/todos/{id}`| Delete a task           |
